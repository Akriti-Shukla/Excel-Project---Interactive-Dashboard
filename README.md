# Excel-Project---Interactive-Dashboard
This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard by integrating data from multiple sources, including SQL databases, CSV files, and PDF. The key steps include: Using Power Query to extract, clean, and load data from external sources. Then I build a relationship model, used pivot chart and slicers for making an interactive dashboard.
